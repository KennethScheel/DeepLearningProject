This GitHub repository contains all project files and data files we used for the project in course 02450 Deep Learning at DTU. The project has been made by

- Laurits Fromberg - s174512

This repository includes the following files

- Project poster for representation
- A .ipynb file containing all code used to generate results (open in Google Colab or Jupyter notebook)

We have also used weather data from DMI. However the files are too big to upload to GitHub, so you can access those via the following Google Drive link:
